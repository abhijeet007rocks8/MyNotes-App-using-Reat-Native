#### This Project helps test the React Native basicx and connection to Firebase database and its usage.

React Native is a JavaScript Library that helps us to generate mobile applications for two major mobile OS namely Android and iOS. Unlike the orthodox methods in which we had to develop same app for both the OS separately, React ANtive generates a cross-platform application. 

## Issue-:
The idea behind the App is that most of the Notes Apps out there store the notes int he System Memory, and it is very much likely when we uninstall the app or some memory issue occurs all the data is lost. 
Another issue is the data only resides in the phone memory so the data is not accessible on other devices and if the device crashes or you forget the device, you cannot access data from other device.

## Solution-:
MyNotes App on the other hand is just a UI to display and store the app and the notes are saved remotely so they are not only safe from device errors but also the notes can be created or accessed from any device as long the person has login credentials(ID and password).

The App is still in improvement phase and so feel free to give ideas or add features in it.
